# Google-books-search
ABOUT:

Users will be able to search and save books from Google Book's API to review and purchase at a later date. This app uses Node, Express, MongoDB, React components, helper/util functions, and React lifecycle methods.

(NOTE: This app is currently under construction to fix the heroku hosting and upgrade the saved articles page)

HOW TO USE:

Once the deployed Heroku link has been opened, type in the title of a book into the search bar and click on the search button. Books that match that title will populate and contain the front cover image, title, author's name(s), description, link to the book's purchasing page, and a save button.

Once the user clicks on a save button, the book's card will be transferred to the save page and stored in the MongoDB for the users to go back to at a later time.
